What is AJAX :-
    . AJAX stands for Asynchronous javascript and XML.
    . It is a technique that combines several technologies like javascript, html, xml, json, etc. to exchange data with a server Asynchronously. (The data query is processed and the data is sent or recieved without reloding the main page ' CRUD is done in background ').
    . AJAX Asynchronously communicates with server using XMLHttpRequest object.
    
    . It is used for creating dynamic web applications.
    . We can update parts of webpage instead of reloading the whole page.(makes web applications faster)



    .JSON/XML can be easiely understood as data representation format.
    . XMLHttpRequest is an API and core of AJAX.
